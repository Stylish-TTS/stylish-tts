# Stylish TTS

Stylish TTS is a lightweight text-to-speech system suitable for offline local use. Our goal is providing consistency for long form text and screen reading with a focus on high quality single speaker models rather than zero-shot voice cloning. The architecture is based on [StyleTTS 2](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2) with many bugfixes, model immprovements, and an improved training process.

TODO: Make some samples

# Getting Started

# Training a Model

In order to train your model, you need a GPU with at least 16 GB of VRAM and PyTorch support and you will need a dataset.

## Preparing a dataset

A dataset consists of many segments. Each segment has a written text and an audio file where that text is spoken by a reader. When using the default model options, the audio must be at least 0.25 seconds long. The upper limit on audio length for a segment will be based on the VRAM of your GPU. You typically want to have audio clips distributed over the whole range of possible lengths. If your range doesn't cover the shortest lengths, your model will sound worse when doing short utterances of one word or a few words. If your range doesn't cover longer lengths which include multiple sentences, your model will tend to skip past punctuation too quickly.

## First Steps

## More Details

# Training New Languages

## Phonemization


# StyleTTS Improved Training Code (still being tested)

This code is mostly the same as the original StyleTTS 2 repo and you
can read the original documentation below.

[Original Repository](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2)

`train_first.py`, `train_second.py`, and
`train_finetune_accelerate.py` have been updated to train faster via
fine-grained dynamic batching and to pad each segment in a batch
instead of randomly clipping them in order to provide a more
deterministic training which converges faster. Validation is done with
a forced batch_size of 1 to provide deterministic validation as well
(an optimization might be to modify validation to use padding as
well).

Based on some experimentation, the original method became increasingly
problematic the larger your batch size became. It is likely the cause
of problems reported when using newer hardware (that allowed higher
batch size) and also some of the problems reported with longer
utterances. In the original clipping method, the larger the
batch_size, the smaller the clips of segments used for training on
average because the smallest clip in each batch was the one used to
determine the clip length.

## Preparing to use the new method

If you have a training list and configuration file that works with the
original training methodology, you can easily adapt it to work with
these modifications.

### Make new training lists from your original list

First, run `make-train-list.py` to generate a mini train list for every 20-frame-long bin in your dataset:

```python make-train-list.py --wav /your/wav/dir --out /your/new/train-dir < your-old-train-list.txt```

### Edit your config.yml file

Then you need to edit your config.yml file.

- Remove the `batch_size` variable
- Change the `max_len` variable to be its old value * the old batch_size

Example with a batch_size that used to be 8 and a max_len that used to be 800:

```max_len: 6400 # maximum number of frames * max batch size```

#### IMPORTANT: Adjusting the max_len is how you deal with memory issues.

Increase it if nvtop reveals you are not using close to the maximum memory and decrease it if you get out of memory exceptions. It operates as a kind of maximum-number-of-batch-frames number now.

It is likely a good idea to have a separate config file with different
max_len for different sub-stages. You can have max_len quite a bit
higher in the initial part of first stage training and then you must
decrease it for TMA. Similarly, for both finetuning and second stage
training you can have max_len higher before style diffusion and joint
adversarial training and then when you get to those sub-stages, reduce
max_len for it loading your last checkpoint. I keep logs and
checkpoints for different sub-stages in different sub-directories as
well, especially given that StyleTTS 2 epoch numbering is a bit wonky
and needs fixed.

Then in `data_params`, edit your `train_data` field to point to the directory of training lists you made with `make-train-list.py`. And add a new `train_bin_count` variable which is 1 larger than the largest number in your training list filename:

```
data_params:
  train_data: "/your/train/dir"
  train_bin_count: 76 # Assumes max segment length of 20 seconds
```

## Running the new training

Now you should be able to run your first, second, or finetune stages
using the training scripts as described in the original documentation
below. The batch size for each batch will automatically adjust to
whatever value keeps it less than the max_len for the given length of
the bin.

## Limitations

I have not modified the original train_finetune.py script so that will
fail. I have not actually tried multispeaker datasets and
configurations, though I believe they should work.

I am providing this mostly so that others can follow in my
footsteps. I might be able to help on the discord but I am not
guaranteeing it will work for you. Ultimately it is up to you to make
it work.

I have used this to finetune a single speaker dataset and to train one
from scratch. So I have a reason to believe in its efficacy.

# StyleTTS 2: Towards Human-Level Text-to-Speech through Style Diffusion and Adversarial Training with Large Speech Language Models

### Yinghao Aaron Li, Cong Han, Vinay S. Raghavan, Gavin Mischler, Nima Mesgarani

> In this paper, we present StyleTTS 2, a text-to-speech (TTS) model that leverages style diffusion and adversarial training with large speech language models (SLMs) to achieve human-level TTS synthesis. StyleTTS 2 differs from its predecessor by modeling styles as a latent random variable through diffusion models to generate the most suitable style for the text without requiring reference speech, achieving efficient latent diffusion while benefiting from the diverse speech synthesis offered by diffusion models. Furthermore, we employ large pre-trained SLMs, such as WavLM, as discriminators with our novel differentiable duration modeling for end-to-end training, resulting in improved speech naturalness. StyleTTS 2 surpasses human recordings on the single-speaker LJSpeech dataset and matches it on the multispeaker VCTK dataset as judged by native English speakers. Moreover, when trained on the LibriTTS dataset, our model outperforms previous publicly available models for zero-shot speaker adaptation. This work achieves the first human-level TTS synthesis on both single and multispeaker datasets, showcasing the potential of style diffusion and adversarial training with large SLMs.

## TODO
- [x] Training and inference demo code for single-speaker models (LJSpeech)
- [x] Test training code for multi-speaker models (VCTK and LibriTTS)
- [x] Finish demo code for multispeaker model and upload pre-trained models
- [x] Add a finetuning script for new speakers with base pre-trained multispeaker models
- [ ] Fix DDP (accelerator) for `train_second.py` **(I have tried everything I could to fix this but had no success, so if you are willing to help, please see [#7](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/issues/7))**

## Pre-requisites
1. Python >= 3.7
2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2.git
cd StyleTTS2
```
3. Install python requirements: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
On Windows add:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 -U
```
Also install phonemizer and espeak if you want to run the demo:
```bash
pip install phonemizer
sudo apt-get install espeak-ng
```
4. Download and extract the [LJSpeech dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/), unzip to the data folder and upsample the data to 24 kHz. The text aligner and pitch extractor are pre-trained on 24 kHz data, but you can easily change the preprocessing and re-train them using your own preprocessing. 
For LibriTTS, you will need to combine train-clean-360 with train-clean-100 and rename the folder train-clean-460 (see [val_list_libritts.txt](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS/blob/main/Data/val_list_libritts.txt) as an example).

## Training
First stage training:
```bash
accelerate launch train_first.py --config_path ./Configs/config.yml
```
Second stage training **(DDP version not working, so the current version uses DP, again see [#7](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/issues/7) if you want to help)**:
```bash
python train_second.py --config_path ./Configs/config.yml
```
You can run both consecutively and it will train both the first and second stages. The model will be saved in the format "epoch_1st_%05d.pth" and "epoch_2nd_%05d.pth". Checkpoints and Tensorboard logs will be saved at `log_dir`. 

The data list format needs to be `filename.wav|transcription|speaker`, see [val_list.txt](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/blob/main/Data/val_list.txt) as an example. The speaker labels are needed for multi-speaker models because we need to sample reference audio for style diffusion model training. 

### Important Configurations
In [config.yml](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/blob/main/Configs/config.yml), there are a few important configurations to take care of:
- `OOD_data`: The path for out-of-distribution texts for SLM adversarial training. The format should be `text|anything`.
- `min_length`: Minimum length of OOD texts for training. This is to make sure the synthesized speech has a minimum length.
- `max_len`: Maximum length of audio for training. The unit is frame. Since the default hop size is 300, one frame is approximately `300 / 24000` (0.0125) second. Lowering this if you encounter the out-of-memory issue. 
- `multispeaker`: Set to true if you want to train a multispeaker model. This is needed because the architecture of the denoiser is different for single and multispeaker models.
- `batch_percentage`: This is to make sure during SLM adversarial training there are no out-of-memory (OOM) issues. If you encounter OOM problem, please set a lower number for this. 

### Pre-trained modules
In [Utils](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/tree/main/Utils) folder, there are three pre-trained models: 
- **[ASR](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/tree/main/Utils/ASR) folder**: It contains the pre-trained text aligner, which was pre-trained on English (LibriTTS), Japanese (JVS), and Chinese (AiShell) corpus. It works well for most other languages without fine-tuning, but you can always train your own text aligner with the code here: [yl4579/AuxiliaryASR](https://github.com/yl4579/AuxiliaryASR).
- **[JDC](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/tree/main/Utils/JDC) folder**: It contains the pre-trained pitch extractor, which was pre-trained on English (LibriTTS) corpus only. However, it works well for other languages too because F0 is independent of language. If you want to train on singing corpus, it is recommended to train a new pitch extractor with the code here: [yl4579/PitchExtractor](https://github.com/yl4579/PitchExtractor).
- **[PLBERT](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/tree/main/Utils/PLBERT) folder**: It contains the pre-trained [PL-BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08810) model, which was pre-trained on English (Wikipedia) corpus only. It probably does not work very well on other languages, so you will need to train a different PL-BERT for different languages using the repo here: [yl4579/PL-BERT](https://github.com/yl4579/PL-BERT). You can also use the [multilingual PL-BERT](https://huggingface.co/papercup-ai/multilingual-pl-bert) which supports 14 languages. 

### Common Issues
- **Loss becomes NaN**: If it is the first stage, please make sure you do not use mixed precision, as it can cause loss becoming NaN for some particular datasets when the batch size is not set properly (need to be more than 16 to work well). For the second stage, please also experiment with different batch sizes, with higher batch sizes being more likely to cause NaN loss values. We recommend the batch size to be 16. You can refer to issues [#10](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/issues/10) and [#11](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/issues/11) for more details.
- **Out of memory**: Please either use lower `batch_size` or `max_len`. You may refer to issue [#10](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/issues/10) for more information.
- **Non-English dataset**: You can train on any language you want, but you will need to use a pre-trained PL-BERT model for that language. We have a pre-trained [multilingual PL-BERT](https://huggingface.co/papercup-ai/multilingual-pl-bert) that supports 14 languages. You may refer to [yl4579/StyleTTS#10](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS/issues/10) and [#70](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/issues/70) for some examples to train on Chinese datasets. 

## Finetuning
The script is modified from `train_second.py` which uses DP, as DDP does not work for `train_second.py`. Please see the bold section above if you are willing to help with this problem. 
```bash
python train_finetune.py --config_path ./Configs/config_ft.yml
```
Please make sure you have the LibriTTS checkpoint downloaded and unzipped under the folder. The default configuration `config_ft.yml` finetunes on LJSpeech with 1 hour of speech data (around 1k samples) for 50 epochs. This took about 4 hours to finish on four NVidia A100. The quality is slightly worse (similar to NaturalSpeech on LJSpeech) than LJSpeech model trained from scratch with 24 hours of speech data, which took around 2.5 days to finish on four A100. The samples can be found at [#65 (comment)](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/discussions/65#discussioncomment-7668393). 

If you are using a **single GPU** (because the script doesn't work with DDP) and want to save training speed and VRAM, you can do (thank [@korakoe](https://github.com/korakoe) for making the script at [#100](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/pull/100)):
```bash
accelerate launch --mixed_precision=fp16 --num_processes=1 train_finetune_accelerate.py --config_path ./Configs/config_ft.yml
```

### Common Issues
[@Kreevoz](https://github.com/Kreevoz) has made detailed notes on common issues in finetuning, with suggestions in maximizing audio quality: [#81](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/discussions/81). Some of these also apply to training from scratch. [@IIEleven11](https://github.com/IIEleven11) has also made a guideline for fine-tuning: [#128](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/discussions/128).

- **Out of memory after `joint_epoch`**: This is likely because your GPU RAM is not big enough for SLM adversarial training run. You may skip that but the quality could be worse. Setting `joint_epoch` a larger number than `epochs` could skip the SLM advesariral training.

## Inference
Please refer to [Inference_LJSpeech.ipynb](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/blob/main/Demo/Inference_LJSpeech.ipynb) (single-speaker) and [Inference_LibriTTS.ipynb](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/blob/main/Demo/Inference_LibriTTS.ipynb) (multi-speaker) for details. For LibriTTS, you will also need to download [reference_audio.zip](https://huggingface.co/yl4579/StyleTTS2-LibriTTS/resolve/main/reference_audio.zip) and unzip it under the `demo` before running the demo.

You can import StyleTTS 2 and run it in your own code. However, the inference depends on a GPL-licensed package, so it is not included directly in this repository. A [GPL-licensed fork](https://github.com/NeuralVox/StyleTTS2) has an importable script, as well as an experimental streaming API, etc. A [fully MIT-licensed package](https://pypi.org/project/styletts2/) that uses gruut (albeit lower quality due to mismatch between phonemizer and gruut) is also available.  

***Before using these pre-trained models, you agree to inform the listeners that the speech samples are synthesized by the pre-trained models, unless you have the permission to use the voice you synthesize. That is, you agree to only use voices whose speakers grant the permission to have their voice cloned, either directly or by license before making synthesized voices public, or you have to publicly announce that these voices are synthesized if you do not have the permission to use these voices.*** 

### Common Issues
- **High-pitched background noise**: This is caused by numerical float differences in older GPUs. For more details, please refer to issue [#13](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/issues/13). Basically, you will need to use more modern GPUs or do inference on CPUs.
- **Pre-trained model license**: You only need to abide by the above rules if you use **the pre-trained models** and the voices are **NOT** in the training set, i.e., your reference speakers are not from any open access dataset. For more details of rules to use the pre-trained models, please see [#37](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2/issues/37).
